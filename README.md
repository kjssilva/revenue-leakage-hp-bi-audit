## Case Study: Business Intelligence & Revenue Recovery

Analyzing the Cost of "Silent Churn" in Digital Funnels

# 🛠 Project Overview

This study analyzes a real-world breakdown in Data Governance and Business Intelligence at a major hardware manufacturer (HP). It explores how fragmented data signals, stale promotional content, and "Pseudo-AI" implementations result in measurable revenue leakage.

📉 The Problem: "The Decision Gap"

Despite having the necessary infrastructure, the organization failed to monitor high-intent user journeys.

 - Data Stale-ness: Trade-in promotions remained live months after expiration (April 2025 vs. February 2026).

 - Funnel Fracture: High-intent traffic from SEO was directed to empty, unmonitored pages.

-  Intent Blindness: Chatbot systems utilized static menus rather than capturing unstructured data to identify user needs.

## 💻 Technical Analysis & Quantification

Using a Python-based Revenue Leakage Model, I simulated the financial impact of these BI failures based on 2026 industry benchmarks.

   - Metric 1 (Conversion Drop): Measured the delta between an optimized funnel (~4%) and a high-friction funnel (0.5%).

   - Metric 2 (Revenue Leakage): Estimated a monthly loss of $630,000 for every 10,000 high-intent visitors.

  -  Metric 3 (CLV Erosion): Projected an annual Customer Lifetime Value loss of ~$18.9M driven by increased brand switching following high-friction user experiences

## 🚀 Proposed BI Solutions

As a BI Consultant, I proposed the following technical interventions:

 - Automated Governance Script:
   * Solution: A Python/SQL-driven monitor that flags promotional assets where expiry_date < current_date.
   * Goal: Eliminate "Trust Decay" caused by stale data.

-  Unstructured Data Capture (NLP):
   * Solution: Implement NLP (Natural Language Processing) on chatbot logs to categorize "Unresolved Intents."
   * Goal: Turn the chatbot from a static menu into a "Frontline Sensor" for market demand.

- Real-Time Friction Dashboard:
   *Solution: A Power BI/Tableau dashboard tracking Time-to-Information (TTI) for high-intent URLs.
   *Goal: Immediate visibility into broken funnels before they reach the quarterly earnings report.# revenue-leakage-hp-bi-audit
